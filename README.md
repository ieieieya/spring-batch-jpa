# spring-batch-jpa

This is an example project that contains everything needed to use Spring Batch 3 to read from a database via JPA and write to a database via JPA. There are also tests.

There were two blog entries associated with this project.

## Spring Batch JPA

## Spring Batch JPA Testing with Transactions
This blog goes over all of the testing options I was able to discover for Spring Batch with JPA.
